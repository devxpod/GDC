# Containerized development tool
## Developer Platform
![Development Environment](./docs/container_dev/images/GenericDevContainer.png "Development Environment")


# Install required tools

**Docker Desktop** is required. If you don't have installed you can install by going to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop  
Run the installer and accept all the defaults.

**Start Docker Desktop, give it more memory, and restart it**
The default is 2GB. Increase this to at least 4GB, we recommend half your system's memory up to 16GB.
![Docker Desktop Config](./docs/container_dev/images/ddesktop-memory.png "Docker Desktop Config")

Ensure that "Use Docker Compose V2" is selected on the General tab. If this is not done your container names will not be correct.  
If your not on windows your screen may look different however there will be a checkbox for Compose V2.
![Docker Desktop Compose V2](./docs/container_dev/images/compose_v2.png "Docker Desktop Compose V2")

If you're on Windows, and it's integrated with WSL2, your Docker Desktop Settings will look like this.

# Setup

## Git config
Set the following environment variables if you want the container to set up your .gitconfig.  
The system will try to copy .gitconfig from you host home before creating one if USE_HOST_HOME=yes.

```bash
GIT_EMAIL=<your email address>
GIT_NAME=<your name>
```

## Update your hosts file
### Mac
Modify `/etc/hosts` and add the line
```
127.0.0.1	host.docker.internal
```
### Windows
Docker Desktop probably did this for you already.
Checkout your hosts file to make sure. `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Run editor as Admin to edit it if necessary.

## Optional
### Symlink `run-dev-container.sh` in the dev container repo to a bin folder in your path.
This will allow you to more easily launch dev containers.

# Concepts
There is only one docker daemon running on the host. The docker daemon does not get run inside the dev container.  
The dev container communicates with the host docker daemon using the docker socket that is mounted inside the dev container.

When you run a container from inside the dev container it is started on the host and runs alongside the dev container.  
There is no container inside container nesting. All containers are siblings.

Building a container inside the dev container will act as expected in terms of file paths / operations.  
The tricky part has to do with volume mounts. Since the newly built container will run alongside the dev container and not in it,
You must specify mount points as absolute host paths.  
Example to mount something from within the dev container workspace:
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
    mycontainer:
        volumes:
          - ${HOST_PROJECT_PATH}/configs/myconfig:/etc/myconfig

```
Ports that are exposed to the host can be accessed inside of containers via host.docker.internal.  
The host record 127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal on the host allows it to use the same name.  
This allows you to use same DNS name both inside and outside of containers.

# Open Directory in Container
Now that you've finished setting up your host.
run the script `run-dev-container.sh` in the root of this repository.

Running with no arguments or `-h` as first arguments will display help.

`run-dev-container.sh [STACK_NAME] [GDC_RUN_MODE | PORT_FWD | GDC_ENTRYPOINT]`

* your current working directory will be mounted in container on `/workspace`
* STACK_NAME if not set via GDC_NAME env var or as first arg will be generated based on current folder.  It's used to name the stack in case you want to run more than one.
* GDC_RUN_MODE optional, valid values are start, stop, daemon, clean. **start** is the default.
* * start will start the GDC environment.
* * daemon will start a GDC environment in the background.
* * stop will shut down a running GDC environment running in foreground or background.
* * clean start GDC environment with CLEAN=yes flag.
* PORT_FWD optional, is in compose port forward format. Example 80:8080 or 4000-4005. You can specify this param more than once.
* GDC_ENTRYPOINT optional, runs a command in the GDC."
* * the docker compose exit code will mirror the return code of the entrypoint command."
* * if the entrypoint command returns a non-zero exit code even if GDC_RUN_MODE=daemon then compose will exit."

## Example Project Configuration
This configuration enables shared DNS between LocalStack and the Dev Container.
The DevContainer will use LocalStack's DNS service.

Create a file called `.env-gdc` in the root of your project direct. Put the following in it:
```shell
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export GDC_NAME=lappc
export LS_VERSION=latest
export LS_IMAGE=localstack/localstack-pro # use localstack/localstack   if you are using LocalStack Community
export USE_LOCALSTACK=yes
export USE_LOCALSTACK_HOST=yes
export USE_LOCALSTACK_PERSISTENCE=no
export USE_LOCALSTACK_DNS=yes # Configure the dev container to use LocalStack for DNS
export LOCALSTACK_HOST_DNS_PORT="" # this makes LocalStack not map port 53 the host
export USE_PRECOMMIT=no
```
If you're using LocalStack Pro, create a file called `.env-gdc-local` and put your LOCALSTACK_API_KEY or LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN in it.
```shell
# Either Key
export LOCALSTACK_API_KEY="<your real key>"
# or
export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN="<your real token>"
```
Run your project with GDC
```shell
run-dev-container.sh
```

# To pass custom environment variables to the dev container prefix variable name with GDC_ENV_
For example, to set a custom environment variable inside the dev container like MY_VAR="MY VALUE". Execute something like the following  
```bash
GDC_ENV_MY_VAR="MY VALUE" run-dev-container.sh proj
```
After shelling into the dev container you can do:
```bash 
echo $MY_VAR
```
You should see "MY VALUE" 

# Environment files
The above environment variable values are the default unless overridden by environment variables setup in your environment or on the command line.   
Specific gdc related env files `GDC_PROJECT_PATH/.env-gdc`, `GDC_PROJECT_PATH/.env-gdc-local`, `$HOST_PROJECT_PATH/.env-gdc` and `$HOST_PROJECT_PATH/.env-gdc-local` will be sourced if they exist in the order listed before building and launching the container.  
`.env-gdc` should be checked in with project and `.env-gdc-local` should be ignored by `.gitignore`.  
## Variables set in the the environment files must be exported! 

Format of the files should be as follows:
```bash
export ENV_VAR_NAME=ENV_VAR_VALUE
```

Example:
```bash
export ROOT_PW=iAmGroot
```

# Special folders
* **/var/run/docker.sock** - mounted from host to allow docker to be used and controlled from within container.
* **/workspace** - folder is the project folder mounted from the host.
* **/root/persisted** - is a persisted volume between containers of same stack.
* **/root/bash_history** - is a persisted volume for bash history between containers of same stack.
* **/root/shared** - is a persisted volume that is shared between all dev containers regardless of stack.
* **/root/home-host** - when USE_HOST_HOME=yes folder is mounted from users home directory on host.
* **/root/gdc-host** - GDC root folder is mounted from host. 
* **/root/.pulumi** - folder is a persisted volume shared between all dev containers.
* **/root/.cache** - folder is a persisted volume shared between all dev containers.
* **/root/.config** - folder is a persisted volume shared between all dev containers.
* **/root/bin-extra** -- folder contains helper scripts for GDC.
* **/root/bin-extra/aws** - folder contains aws related helper scripts. Only added to path if USE_AWS=yes is set.
* **/root/bin-extra/docker** - folder contains docker related helper files and is added to path.
* **/root/bin-extra/ls** - folder for localstack helper files and is added to path.
* **/root/bin-extra/auth0** - folder for auth0 helper files and is added to path. 
* **/root/bin** - when USE_HOST_HOME=yes and USE_HOME_BIN=yes folder is copied from /root/home-host/bin if it exists.
* **/root/.aws** - when USE_AWS_HOME=yes folder is copied from /root/home-host/.aws if it exists, otherwise it will be symlinked to /root/shared/.aws volume if it exists.
* **/usr/local/share/.cache** - used to persist cache for npm, yarn, and pip


## .bashrc hook
When **.bashrc** is loaded if the following file is present it will be sourced `/root/persisted/bash_rc_ext.sh`.
This allows persisted customization to login shell.

# GIT pre-commit hooks
When the environment var **USE_PRECOMMIT=yes** the container on startup will check if pre-commit has already been set up on project.  
If it has not it will do a `pre-commit install` in the /workspace folder which should map to the repository root.  
The repository should have commit rules setup to run formatting and linting before the commit.  
Python files will be formatted using black and flake8 standards, so you should ensure your IDE of choice is set the same.  
On your first commit the pre-commit plugin will need to download and install some additional plugins, so you may experience a delay on 1st commit.  
If any files fail to format or pass lint after being formatted the commit will be rejected until the issues displayed are corrected.


# Examples
### Create a dev container for a project finance-portal stored in /repos folder.
* Disables color prompt in shell
* Mounts /repos/finance-portal to /workspace inside of container.
* names the dev stack "fp"
* Forwards port 3030 inside container to host port 3030.
```bash
USE_COLOR_PROMPT=no /repos/generic-dev-container/run-dev-container.sh /repos/finance-portal fp 3030:3030
```

### Create a dev container in current folder and start SSH server in container
* Launch dev container in current folder
* Names the stack "dev"
* Enables SSH server and forwards port 1022 on host to sshd in container
* sets root password to IamGroot
```bash
SSH_SERVER_PORT=1022 ROOT_PW=IamGroot `pwd` dev
```

### Open shell inside of container with stack named "fp"
```bash
docker exec -it fp-dev-1 bash -l
```
You want to specify the "-l" parameter to bash to ensure it behaves as a login shell.  
**Failure to do so may cause some environment variables to unset or incorrect.**  
Also note that using the shell button in the docker services tab of your does not execute the shell as a login shell.  
Instead you should find the dev container in the container list right click it and select "Exec"  
Then select the "Create and run" option and type "bash -l"  
After doing this once you only have to right-click on container select "Exec" and click the already available option of "bash -l"


### Open `/repos/finance-portal` in your favorite IDE and edit as you like.

### Assume an AWS role in the dev container
AWS_USERNAME is usually first_name.last_name but that is not a strict requirement and depends on your setup.  
AWS_PROFILE_NAME is how you named your aws profile in your aws config file.
```bash
source assume-role.sh AWS_USERNAME AWS_PROFILE_NAME arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_NUM:role/ROLE_NAME MFA_TOKEN
```

### Sample using real values
```bash
source assume-role.sh paul.robello paul-identity arn:aws:iam::441193001985:role/sandboxAdmin MFA_TOKEN
```

### Connect to AWS jumphost after assuming role
JUMP_HOST_REGION is the aws region where the jumphost is deployed examples us-west-2, us-east-1, etc...
```bash
export AWS_REGION=JUMP_HOST_REGION;export AWS_PROFILE=AWS_PROFILE_NAME;ssm-ssh.sh JUMP_HOST_INSTANCE_ID
```
### Sample using real values
```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2;export AWS_PROFILE=paul-identity;ssm-ssh.sh i-04b4c8a1ddc845fb8
```

### Forward port from dev container to AWS service after assuming role
JUMP_HOST_REGION_WITH_AZ means you must append the correct availability zone where the jumphost is deployed a,b,c,d to the region. Example us-west2a
```bash
export AWS_REGION=JUMP_HOST_REGION;ssm-jump-tunnel.sh JUMP_HOST_INSTANCE_ID JUMP_HOST_REGION_WITH_AZ LOCAL_PORT REMOTE_HOST REMOTE_PORT
```

### Sample using real values
```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2;ssm-jump-tunnel.sh i-04b4c8a1ddc845fb8 us-west-2a 6432 rds-cluster-dev.cluster-ao65ukd5fsic.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com 5432
```
If you want to use a tool on your host to connect to the tunnel opened in your dev container then you must forward the port to the host when creating the dev container.  
Example if you want to use pg_admin on your host to connect to an RDS in AWS, you would create the container with something like
```bash
run-dev-container.sh fp 6432:6432
```
Then assume your role and forward your port like the examples above.  
Then you can open pg_admin on your host and connect to 127.0.0.1:6432.  
This will pass the connection from the host port 6431 to the container port 6432 which will then be forwarded through the jump tunnel to the rds on port 5432.


# Networking
### devnet
A special virtual network named "**devnet**" is created and all dev containers are attached to it.
This allows them all to communicate with one another as well as any other containers attached to it.  
Its recommended that if you create additional containers that you attach them to the same network to allow for easier debug and connections.
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mycontainer:
    networks:
      devnet:

networks:
  devnet:
    external: true
```
The network name for devnet can be overridden with environment variable DEVNET_NAME

### /var/run/docker.sock
The docker socket is mounted inside the dev container giving it full access to the docker daemon.

### PORT_FWD1 environment variable
This enables a single port or port rage to be forwarded from the host to the container.  
Example:  PORT_FWD1="8080:80" would forward port 8080 from host to port 80 inside the dev container.

### PORT_FWD2 environment variable
This enables a single port or port rage to be forwarded from the host to the container.  
Example:  PORT_FWD2="2000-2020" would forward port range 2000-2020 from host to corresponding ports inside the dev container.

### SSH_SERVER_PORT
This enables the sshd server in the container and starts it inside the container on port 22,
then forwards the specified port on the host to port 22 inside the container.
Example:  SSH_SERVER_PORT=1022  would forward port 1022 on the host to port 22 inside the dev container.

## Troubleshooting

### GDC Startup
If your GDC fails to start with an error similar to "failed to solve: executor failed running ..."

This happens when cached layers don't match what the Docker file thinks is already in place.

You can try one of the following environment variables to resolve the error.  
Many times only CLEAN=yes is needed, however if the problem persist you can use CLEAN_ONLY=yes then start the GDC as you normally would.

* CLEAN=yes - stops and removes existing stack and devnet, then does docker system prune before starting new dev container.
* CLEAN_ONLY=yes - stops and removes existing stack and devnet, then does docker system prune and exits.

### Localstack won't let go of old state
* All OS stop all GDC's and localstack containers and remove the following folders if they exist.
* $HOST_PROJECT_PATH/ls_volume folder
* /tmp/ls_volume*
* /c/tmp/ls_volume*

* start GDC and run  *make reset*
